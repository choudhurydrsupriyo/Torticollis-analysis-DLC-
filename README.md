# Torticollis-analysis-DLC-
I have taken a video (around 10 seconds, 30 FPS) of a patient with right torticollis and analysed it using DeepLabCut (DLC). It finally generated a .csv file mentioning the cordinates of 
few surface land marks. The one we analysed was the nose- bridge and the centre of neck (Adam's apple). We calculated the distance of nose bridge from the centre over time.
The right sided area under the curve from the centre mesuring the horizontal shift and the same for left side was estimated. The standard deviation of the horizontal movement 
was also calculated. These can be some kinematic measures for torticollis.
